<h3>BNCC At a Glance:</h3>
<p>Bangladesh National Cadet Corps (BNCC) has a long glorious history. Many members of this organization (the then UOTC) took an active part in our great War of independence and had supreme sacrifices. Bangladesh National Cadet Corps (BNCC) was established in 1979 under the provisions of the Indian Territorial Force Act 1950 which was replaced by BNCC Act no 46 in the year 2016. The main function of this organization is to organize and train the selected students of schools, colleges, and universities with the aim of developing their leadership qualities, sense of duty, commitment, dedication, discipline, and moral value so that they become good/useful citizens.</p>
